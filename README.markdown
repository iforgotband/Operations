# Declaration of Purpose

Development Operations, or DevOps as we like to call it, refers to the processes by which a bunch
of unstable code monkies are herded in a productive fashion. It's an answer to the chaos that
arisis from the process of multiple people (or just one very disorganized person such as myself)
attempting to work on the same complex set of documents, at the same time. Clearly, the solution
is in automation, and the idea of Continuous Integration. This particular Ops repository is here
to serve as a template for new Ops packages, and also the repository of those that already exist,
If you adapt this to another workflow other than what we already have, we ask that you 
contribute it back, as described in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.markdown).
